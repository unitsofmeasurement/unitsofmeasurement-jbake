Apache SIS is a Java language library for developing geospatial
applications. SIS provides data structures for geographic features and
associated metadata along with methods to manipulate those data
structures. The library is an implementation of GeoAPI 3.0 interfaces
and can be used for desktop or server applications.

Some Apache SIS features are:

  * Geographic metadata (ISO 19115)
      o Read/write ISO 19139 compliant XML documents
      o Read from netCDF, GeoTIFF, Landsat, GPX and Moving Feature CSV
        encoding
  * Referencing by coordinates (ISO 19111) or by identifiers (ISO 19112)
      o Well Known Text (WKT) version 1 and 2 (ISO 19162)
      o Geographic Markup Language (GML) version 3.2 (ISO 19136)
      o Geodetic objects and operations from EPSG geodetic dataset
      o Mercator, Lambert, stereographic and more map projections
      o Geohashes and Military Grid Reference System (MGRS)
      o Optional bridge to Proj.4 as a complement to Apache SIS own
        referencing engine
  * Units of measurement
      o **JSR-363** with parsing, formating and unit conversion functionalities
