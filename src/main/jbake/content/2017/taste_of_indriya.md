We recently did a [survey](https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement/unit-ri/issues/67) about a matching future code name for a Units of Measurement RI. Anticipating a follow-up JSR along a [proposed redefinition of SI base units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_redefinition_of_SI_base_units). The winner was [Indriya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indriya), the Sanskrit word for sense.

While officially in "Stealth Mode" until a new JSR starts, please have a look at [Indriya](https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement/indriya). It is based on [uom-se](https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement/uom-se) with a few tweaks and improvements like the first draft of a [CompoundUnit] (https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement/indriya/issues/1) etc. Therefore fully compatible with the API and other existing implementations. It is a bit early, but for those who like their "coffee" fresh and hot, please feel free to already taste it.
