Following Apache SIS 0.8 Eclipse UOMo 0.7 offers another compatible JSR 363 implementation. A Release Candidate is available [here](https://www.eclipse.org/uomo/download.php). You can find a matching TCK harness under https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement/unit-tck-usage/tree/uomo.

Until EMO concludes the Release review, please build UOMo 0.7 from source or install it into a local Maven repository before running the tests. After that we'll make UOMo 0.7 available in public repositories like JCenter or MavenCentral.
