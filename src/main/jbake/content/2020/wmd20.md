The theme for World Metrology Day 2020 is Measurements for global trade. This theme was chosen to create awareness of the important role measurement plays in facilitating fair global trade, ensuring products meet standards and regulations, and satisfying customer quality expectations.

We plan to release domain specific extension modules, libraries or demos for JSR 385 and Units of Measurement in the upcoming weeks and months to support Measurements for trade and business.
