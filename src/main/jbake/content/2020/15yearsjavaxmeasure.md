Today marks the 15th anniversary of the JSR 275 <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/results?id=3216">creation review ballot</a>. 
2005 was also the "World Year of Physics" or "Einstein Year", celebrating Einstein's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_Mirabilis_papers">Annus Mirabilis papers</a> being published 100 years earlier, the first on the 9th of June, 1905.

Since its creation, the JSR 275 API was downloaded nearly 855,000 times from a Maven compliant repository alone. In the last 12 months, the "javax.measure" APIs were downloaded more than A Million times, with Unit-API (JSR 363/385) now getting more downloads per year than 275 did in its entire lifetime, but it also still is downloaded around 250k times, a number not all Open Source projects hold, especially after 15 years.
