May 20 is [World Metrology Day](http://www.worldmetrologyday.org), commemorating the anniversary of the signing of the Metre Convention in 1875.

This year, we celebrate the 150th anniversary of the signing of the Metre Convention - a milestone that underscores a century and a half of international collaboration in measurement science. Also the [OIML](https://www.oiml.org/en), the International Organization of Legal Metrology, turns 70 on October 12th this year.

The theme for World Metrology Day 2025 is Measurements for all times, for all people.

We also released [version 2.2.2](https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement/si-units/releases/tag/2.2.2) of [SI Units](http://uom.si/).
