JFrog recently announced, that by May 1st, 2021 Bintray/JCenter, GoCenter and ChartCenter will be discontinued, seemingly giving in to stronger competitors like MavenCentral, ArtifactHub or pkg.go.dev, see: https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/

So it's time to kiss JFrog Goodbye and move on to use MavenCentral/Sonatype repositories instead. The only case where we explore the possibility of Artifactory in the Cloud for Open Source projects is the limited area of Eclipse P2 repositories.
