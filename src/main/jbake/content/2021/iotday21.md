After visiting IoT Meetup Zurich several times in person, I was honored to virtually join it again and give a short version of the JSR 385 talk at [IoT Day 2021 Virtual Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/IoT-Zurich/events/277320104/).

It was nice to see an old picture from the 2014 event:

Hope to join it again in person another year.
