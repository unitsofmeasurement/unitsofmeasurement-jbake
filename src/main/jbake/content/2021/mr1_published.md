![JSR 385 MR1](/img/maintenance-1151312_320.png "Maintenance")

Yesterday Maintenance Release 1 of JSR 385 was published by the Java Community Process: https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/mrel/jsr385/index.html

It took a while, probably including fewer meetings and activities, we also had to send the Spec Documents again with different dates, but thanks everyone for getting all the deliverables out there now.

Corresponding GitHub release tags for API are: https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement/unit-api/releases/tag/2.1.1
