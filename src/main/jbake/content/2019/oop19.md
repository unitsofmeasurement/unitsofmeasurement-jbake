At [OOP 2019](https://www.oop-konferenz.de/oop2019/startseite-englisch.html) in Munich [Filip](https://github.com/filipvanlaenen) and [Werner](https://github.com/keilw) gave the audience a chance of [Learning from the 125 Million Dollar Mars Climate Orbiter Mistake](https://www.oop-konferenz.de/oop2019/startseite-englisch/program/sessiondetails/action/detail/session/do-23-4/title/jsr-385-learning-from-the-125-million-dollar-mars-climate-orbiter-mistake.html?tx_dmconferences_session%5BshowRooms%5D=0&cHash=ae8cd0224ec0f74399cc148402e8e90f) and how JSR-385 could have prevented it.

During the session a "Graphic Novel" of the session was created:
![OOP Graphic Novel](/img/IMG_20190124_155810_888_768x768.jpg "Graphic Novel about JSR-385")

So Filip and Werner are actual ***Comic Heroes*** now ;-D
According to OOP organizers the session was very well received by attendees, too.
