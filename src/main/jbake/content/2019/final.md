Judgement Day

![JSR 385 Judgement Day](/img/T2_Final.png "Judgement Day")

On Thursday, August 29, 2019 the **Final Release** of JSR 385 was published by the Java Community Process: https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr385/index.html.

The date coincides with **Judgement Day** in the [Terminator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_2:_Judgment_Day) movies.
If a computer system like Skynet ever did become self-aware, hopefully it gets not only its measurement units right. If it ran on Java, then JSR 385 might help ;-)
