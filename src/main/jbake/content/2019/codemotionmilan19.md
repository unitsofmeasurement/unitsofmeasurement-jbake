Do you know what happened on July 20 1969 at 20 UTC? Does the “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind” ring a bell…? Yes, it’s moon landing! 2019 was the 50th anniversary of this historical milestone, so Codemotion decided to celebrate it during its 2019 Conferences around Europe.

In particular, Codemotion Milan 19 was the selected location of some special events. Among the speakers, we had the pleasure to listen to Don Eyles (October, 24) and Russ Olsen (October, 25) as keynote speakers.

Before our own JSR 385 session at Codemotion Milan 2019 at October, 25, Thodoris and Werner had the privilege to interview both Don Eyles and Russ Olson.
