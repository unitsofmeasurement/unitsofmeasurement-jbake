After a great Eclipse DemoCamp Trondheim last year, I was invited to talk about [UOMo](http://www.eclipse.org/uomo/), JSR 363 and the Quantified Self at [Eclipse Luna DemoCamp Trondheim](http://www.meetup.com/Trondheim-Eclipse-User-Group/events/170849682/)

We continued with a practical exercise of measuring a few "Pints" in the city. Interestingly after my "Measure for Measure" themed talk the pub was named "Macbeth" just like the other (probably more famous) play by William Shakespeare;-)

The following 2 days, the Force (in Newton;-D) was very strong with me, when I presented the improved version of [Heart of Glass](http://java-embedded-challenge.github.io/heart-of-glass/) from last year's JavaOne Raspberry Pi Challenge at [Trondheim Maker Faire](http://www.trondheimmakerfaire.no/en/).

I offered to measure his pulse and heart rate, but he didn't want to get out of his body armor;-D
