After JSR 363 passed the Creation Review, the first public presentation took part on World IoT Day 2014. I visited [IoT MeetUp Zurich](http://www.meetup.com/IoT-Zurich/events/166408222/).

The hosts were quite honored to have someone from outside Switzerland come by, and we all enjoyed Thai Curry cooked in a Raspberry Pi powered [EveryCook](http://www.everycook.org/) device.
