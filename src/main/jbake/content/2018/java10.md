Indriya and JSR 385 are ready for and working with Java 10!
While the API and Indriya remain fully backward compatible with Java SE 8 and at least the API will do (for Indriya we may explore [Multi-release JARs](https://blog.codefx.org/tools/multi-release-jars-multiple-java-versions/) if it was highly beneficial and justified the increased JAR size) both work perfectly fine with Java 10.

The first [Units of Measurement Console Demos](https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement/uom-demos/tree/master/console/java10) show how to use the Java 10 `var` feature with JSR 385 and Indriya. More to come. Stay tuned or contribute Java 9, 10 or 11 support you would like to see and use.
