Following a recent vote [Indriya #35](https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement/indriya/issues/35) we decided to switch from virtual TLDs ".tec", the only option back in 2014 to actual new "tech" TLDs that became usable after 2015. A small difference, but with domains like "uom.tech" or "units.tech" we can also use them for web pages and email addresses.

Similar to JSR 363 "units.tech" will be reserved for the JSR (mostly RI and TCK) while "uom.tech" serves the wider project and all other artifacts.

Find them on Search.maven.org under [tech.units](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ctech.units) or [tech.uom](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ctech.uom)
