On the last day of DevoXX BE 2015 in Antwerp, after many had already seen cutting edge QS and Embedded technologies in [James Bond Spectre](http://www.devoxx.be/2015/10/james-bond/) and a literal [hands-on IoT session](http://cfp.devoxx.be/2015/talk/EDW-7208/Providing_Eyes,_Ears,_and_a_Mouth_to_Your_IoT_Project) by Yara and Vinicius, Werner presented [The First IoT JSR: Units of Measurement](http://cfp.devoxx.be/2015/talk/PPU-4757/The_First_IoT_JSR:_Units_of_Measurement_). Unfortunately, JSR 363 EG members and co-speakers Mohamed and Otavio could not make it due to travel budget constraints.
While two Cloud/Big Data sessions by both Google and Microsoft as well as a "CSI: Cyber" style security talk by highly acclaimed Security consultant and Hacker Dan Tentler drew a large portion of the crowd to the other 3 rooms, it still ended up with a decent crowd, exceeding all other JSR 363 related talks of 2015, including a similar DevoXX UK session in London. 

For everyone who did not attend the session or wants to watch it again, here's the YouTube recording:
