Just a day after NASA had unveiled new images and details about Mars, I presented Data Quality and Unit standards from SensorML to ISO 80000 and how JSR 363 can support them at Apache Big Data Europe 2015 in Budapest:

It was also a chance to meet EG veteran (initial member of JSR 108 already) and fellow speaker Martin.
