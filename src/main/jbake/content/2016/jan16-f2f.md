Leonardo, Werner and Otavio met for an EG F2F in Rio de Janeiro. As the <a href="../2015/pr.html">Public Review</a> Ballot of JSR 363 was just about to conclude, Leonardo and Werner gave a Spec Lead presentation to the EC answering questions of EC members prior to their vote.

After the presentation great host TOTVS invited attendees to a ride up Sugarloaf Montain with the cable car, many probably know from the James Bond movie "Moonraker".

Werner used the opportunity to track <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/482729393">the ride on Strava</a>. More of that coming soon to <a href="https://www.doag.org/konferenz/konferenzplaner/konferenzplaner_details.php?id=499959&locS=0&vid=509382"> JavaLand</a>...

Although some EC members had to travel back a bit longer or later than expected due to Blizzard Jason causing major traffic disruption, all but 2 members were able to vote on the <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/results?id=5837">Public Review</a> of JSR 363 the following Monday and it passed with only "Yes" votes by all who voted.
