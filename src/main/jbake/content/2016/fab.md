Yesterday, the Final Approval Ballot for JSR 363 at the Java Community Process finished:
https://jcp.org/en/jsr/results?id=5877.

JSR 363 was approved by the JCP Executive Committee.

The Final Release page should be published on JCP.org any time soon (probably a bit hectic before JavaOne;-)

In the meantime, please refer to MavenCentral, Bintray JCenter or GitHub.

Corresponding GitHub release tags for API are:
https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement/unit-api/releases/tag/1.0
for the RI:
https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement/unit-ri/releases/tag/1.0
and for the TCK:
https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement/unit-tck/releases/tag/1.0

Most other artifacts like unit systems, libraries or [uom-demos](https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement/uom-demos) got corresponding tags like "Final Release" or "Final equivalent" buiding upon 1.0. All of them except demos can also be found either on MavenCentral, Bintray JCenter or both.
