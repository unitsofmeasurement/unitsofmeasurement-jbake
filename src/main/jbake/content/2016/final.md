Final Release page: https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr363/index.html

Corresponding GitHub release tags for API are: https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement/unit-api/releases/tag/1.0
for the RI: https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement/unit-ri/releases/tag/1.0
and for the TCK: https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement/unit-tck/releases/tag/1.0

Most other artifacts like unit systems, libraries or [uom-demos](https://github.com/unitsofmeasurement/uom-demos) got corresponding tags like "Final Release" or "Final equivalent" buiding upon 1.0. All of them except demos can also be found either on MavenCentral, Bintray JCenter or both.
